*Whimpering*
Hey man, are you okay?
Uh... Uawah.... My family...
Your family?
Yeah... my family is gone... because of the craps. They killed my mother, father, and baby sister. I don't know what to do now...
Same! The crabs stole all of our food supply and my mother had to suffer because of that.
Oh.. I am so sorry.
Look what the crabs did to my home! The entire place is rubble now. My life is over. 
But wait! Life has more to offer! Let's get revenge... on the crabs. 
What are you talking about? 
Crab Corp. is the organization that has been destroying our lives. We can take them down.
The two of us?
Yes! Let's do it together!
Okay!
